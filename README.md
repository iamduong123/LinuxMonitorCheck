# Linux System Monitor

This project is a Bash-based Linux system monitoring script designed to simulate real-world DevOps monitoring tasks. 

It continuously tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage, sends alerts when thresholds are exceeded, and logs resource usage with timestamps. This project demonstrates:

- **Automation**: Continuous monitoring without manual intervention
- **Logging**: Persistent tracking of system metrics
- **Alerting**: Immediate notification when resources exceed thresholds
- **Bash scripting & Linux tools**: `top`, `free`, `df`, and shell scripting
